# Our Story


Massive progress is taking place in enabling AI for the enterprise: from foundation models and guardrails, to development frameworks and retrieval technologies, the pace of technical innovation is unmatched since the dawn of the information age. Seeing the tremendous opportunity this technology represents, and the massive gap between the promise of the technology and the reality of putting it to work for business, our founding team set out to bridge the gap.

<div>

Despite headwinds (scarcity of talent, of computer hardware for training and inference, cost scaling, and lack of a consensus approach to risk management for both the enterprise and societal impacts) venture investment in the technology sector and strategic investments at leading enterprises are starting to turn the promise of AI foundation models into an exciting new reality.

Before these promising technical capabilities can turn into sustainable business value, much less herald the transformation of industry that is in the offing, they will have to be adapted to support the needs and processes of industry: reliability, transparency, and effecitve application to business processes. This is especially true for critical services in regulated industries.
